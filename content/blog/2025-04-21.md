Welcome to the first edition of my biweekly music recommendations. Trigger Warning: My music taste is very hit or miss, most people either totally agree or blacklist me for the rest of their days. 

### Vibe Check
Recently, I've been feeling excited and motivated, especially with school resuming after Spring Break. My music taste has reflected this hype vibe, centering around a lot of electronic and energetic music. I'd characterize this as a **high** phase in my life, rather than a low: I'd recommend listening to these songs if you're feeling ready to get back out into the world and make some new memories.
