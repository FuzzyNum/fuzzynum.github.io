Hello, this is a test blog post. Below are the lyrics to Stolen Dance by Milky Chance:

[Milky Chance - Stolen Dance (Official Music Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX-QaNzd-0Y&pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD)

I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They've always been so kind
But now they've brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us

And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on
Doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on
Doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it

Coldest winter for me
No Sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense is controlling my mind
I cannot find the way out of here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on
Doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on
Doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it

And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on
Doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on
Doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it
